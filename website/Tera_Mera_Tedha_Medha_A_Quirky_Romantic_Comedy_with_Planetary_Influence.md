Tera Mera Tedha Medha is a movie that explores the concept of planetary disposition, which is the belief that the position and movement of planets affect the lives and destinies of human beings. According to this belief, each planet has a specific influence on different aspects of life, such as health, wealth, career, marriage, etc. The movie focuses on two planets in particular: Shani and Mangal.
 
Shani is the planet of discipline, justice, karma and hardship. It is considered to be a malefic planet that brings obstacles, delays, challenges and misfortunes to those who are under its influence. However, Shani also teaches valuable lessons and rewards hard work and perseverance. In the movie, Rajan is under the influence of Shani, which makes him a timid, pessimistic and unlucky person who faces many difficulties in his life and career.
 
Mangal is the planet of energy, courage, passion and aggression. It is considered to be a benefic planet that brings enthusiasm, confidence, success and vitality to those who are under its influence. However, Mangal also causes impulsiveness, anger, violence and accidents to those who are not careful. In the movie, Kamini is under the influence of Mangal, which makes her a bold, optimistic and lucky person who enjoys life and career.
 
The movie shows how Rajan and Kamini's contrasting personalities and planetary influences create conflicts and misunderstandings between them, but also attract them to each other. The movie also shows how Swati's interference affects their relationship and how they overcome the challenges posed by Shani and Mangal.
